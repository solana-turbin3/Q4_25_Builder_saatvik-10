# Turbin3_Q4_Rust
What it does??
- Creating new wallets for Solana on-chain interactions
- Converting wallet keys between different formats (e.g., from base58 to byte array)
- Requesting airdrops of SOL tokens to newly created wallets (Devnet)
- Interacting with the Turbin3 program on the Solana blockchain and minting a special NFT indicating a successful completion of the Q4 Rust assignment

Each step was ran as a separate test function to ensure modularity and ease of debugging.
